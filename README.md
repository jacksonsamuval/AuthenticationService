### Features:

- User Registration: Allows users to create an account with necessary details.
- JWT Authentication: Issues JWTs upon successful login, which can be used for accessing protected resources.
- Token Validation: Validates incoming JWTs to ensure they are not expired and are correctly signed.
- User Management: Provides endpoints for user management tasks like password reset and account verification.

### Technology Stack:
